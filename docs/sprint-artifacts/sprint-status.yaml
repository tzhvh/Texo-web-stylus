# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================

#   - contexted: Next epic tech context created by *epic-tech-context (required)
#
# Story Status:
#   - drafted: Story file created in stories folder by *create-story
#   - ready-for-dev: Draft approved and story context created by *story-ready
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation by *dev-story
#   - review: Implementation complete, ready for review by *code-review
#   - done: Story completed by *story-done

# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epics should be 'contexted' before stories can be 'drafted'
# - SM typically drafts next story ONLY after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', dev reviews, then Dev moves to 'done'
