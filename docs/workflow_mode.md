# Workflow Mode and Context Analysis

## Workflow Mode: REPLACING

**Existing epics.md found!**

Current structure:
- 6 epics defined  
- 42 total stories
- 98 FRs covered

**User Choice:** REPLACING mode - Start fresh, discard existing epic structure

## Context Analysis:

✅ Architecture found - will add technical implementation notes
✅ Course correction already executed (Single-Active-Row Architecture) - will incorporate new architectural decisions
✅ Full PRD analysis completed - 104 FRs extracted and organized

## Available Context for Enhancement:

- ✅ PRD requirements (completely analyzed and updated for course correction)
- ✅ Architecture technical decisions (comprehensive technical specifications)
- ℹ️ No UX Design found (Magic Canvas UX principles already well-defined in PRD)

## Enhancement Plan:

Creating completely new epic breakdown that incorporates:
- Course correction architectural decisions (single-active-row model)
- Technical implementation details from architecture document
- Updated FR inventory reflecting course correction changes
- Comprehensive story breakdown with vertical slicing
- Performance targets and error handling strategies
- Complete FR coverage matrix

Stories will be created from scratch with full technical specifications for implementation guidance that aligns with new simplified architecture and all architectural decisions.
